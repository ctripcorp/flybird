**schema_url.json**

## Pscripts

Store custom scripts in python language (including custom step statements, docking with other platforms such as mocks, custom schema jump logic, login and logout, extension of various hook functions when behave is running, parameter processing methods, etc.)

app/operation.py : Define some app-specific behaviors, such as the splicing of the schema jump protocol, login, logout, and jump to the homepage

- dsl.step：Custom dsl statements, if you create a new .py file to write custom statements, you need to import the .py file in feature/steps/steps.py

- dsl.hook：The extension of each hook function in the execution process, so that users can exert their own influence on the execution process

- other_platform：Stores some code that interacts with other platforms, which can be added or deleted

- params_deal：Store some custom processing methods
